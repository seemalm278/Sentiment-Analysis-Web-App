# 😊 Sentiment Analysis Web Application

An end-to-end AI-powered Sentiment Analysis Web Application that predicts whether a user's text expresses a **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiment. This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to deploying a web application using FastAPI and a responsive frontend.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This application uses a machine learning model trained on a sentiment dataset to classify text into one of three categories:

- 😊 Positive
- 😐 Neutral
- 😞 Negative

Users enter text through a simple web interface, and the application sends it to a FastAPI backend, where the trained model predicts the sentiment and returns the result instantly.

This project was built to understand the complete lifecycle of an AI application, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, backend development, frontend integration, testing, and deployment.
